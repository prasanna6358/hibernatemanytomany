Let us see the flow of spring MVC (3.2). I am not going to describe what is M,V,C :-) hope you already know that mess right ? so lets start with the flow…



== Spring MVC Execution Flow
.  Step 1: First request will be received by DispatcherServlet
.  Step 2: DispatcherServlet will take the help of HandlerMapping and get to know the Controller class name associated with the given request
.  Step 3: So request transfer to the Controller, and then controller will process the request by executing appropriate methods and returns ModeAndView object (contains Model data and View name) back to the DispatcherServlet
.  Step 4: Now DispatcherServlet send the model object to the ViewResolver to get the actual view page
.  Step 5: Finally DispatcherServlet will pass the Model object to the View page to display the result

That’s it :-)
